		  <h1>For this project, we had a turtle named Pablo run into a flower, spin around, change color, and run into a lake. The project also includes fish, a sun, clouds, grass, and a bird that also moves around. Most of these images were drawn using while loops or just by using a turtle image.</h1>
		  <h1>Here is my PLTW 1.2.5 Project:</h1>

		  <h1>For this project, we had a ball float left and right across the top of the screen with a basketball hoop below. To make the ball fall, we would press the letter "a." Each time the ball falls through the hoop, your score is updated and you get a point which shows at the top left of the screen.</h1>

		  <h1>For this project, we tried to recreate the Google Dinosaur game, but with Mario. Bowser would run towards Mario with random speeds, and the player would have to press space to control mario and make him jump over bowser. There were collision functions, gravity, and screen scrolling all in place to make this game happen.</h1>
